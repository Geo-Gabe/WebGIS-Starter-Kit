# WebGIS Starter Kit
WebGIS maps are great, but they require a lot of time and money to set up. 

We all want to create cool web GIS maps, but we don't have the budget or the skills required for setting them up.

With our starter kit you can stop worrying about installing expensive software or hiring an expensive GIS expert. WebGIS Starter Kit is designed with simplicity in mind so that anyone can quickly get started on creating their own web GIS map.

This project uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
